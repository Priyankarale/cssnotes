3.SYNTAX
   A CSS comprises of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then
applied to the corresponding elements in your document. A style rule is made of
three parts:
1. Selector: A selector is an HTML tag at which a style will be applied. This
could be any tag like <h1> or <table> etc.
2. Property: A property is a type of attribute of HTML tag. Put simply, all the
HTML attributes are converted into CSS properties. They could
be color, border, etc.
3. Value: Values are assigned to properties. For example, color property can
have the value either red or #F1F1F1 etc.

You can put CSS Style Rule Syntax as follows:
selector { property: value }

Example: You can define a table border as follows:
table{ border :1px solid #C00; }

Here table is a selector and border is a property and the given value 1px solid
#C00 is the value of that property.

4.You can define selectors in various simple ways based on your comfort. Let me
put these selectors one by on.
1.The Type Selectors
This is the same selector we have seen above. Again, one more example to give
a color to all level 1 headings:
h1 {
 color: #36CFFF;
}
2.The Universal Selectors
Rather than selecting elements of a specific type, the universal selector quite
simply matches the name of any element type:
* {
 color: #000000;
}
This rule renders the content of every element in our document in black
3.The Descendant Selectors
Suppose you want to apply a style rule to a particular element only when it lies
inside a particular element. As given in the following example, the style rule will
apply to <em> element only when it lies inside the <ul> tag.
ul em {
 color: #000000;
}
4.The Class Selectors
You can define style rules based on the class attribute of the elements. All the
elements having that class will be formatted according to the defined rule.
.black {
 color: #000000;
}
This rule renders the content in black for every element with class attribute set
to black in our document. You can make it a bit more particular. For example:
h1.black {
 color: #000000;
}
This rule renders the content in black for only <h1> elements with class
attribute set to black.
5.The Child Selectors
You have seen the descendant selectors. There is one more type of selector,
which is very similar to descendants but have different functionality. Consider
the following example:
body > p {
 color: #000000;
}
This rule will render all the paragraphs in black if they are a direct child of the
<body> element. Other paragraphs put inside other elements like <div> or
<td> would not have any effect of this rule.
6.You can also apply styles to HTML elements with particular attributes. The style
rule below will match all the input elements having a type attribute with a value
of text:
input[type="text"]{
 color: #000000;
}
7.Grouping Selectors
You can apply a style to many selectors if you like. Just separate the selectors
with a comma, as given in the following example:
h1, h2, h3 {
color: #36C;
font-weight: normal;
letter-spacing: .4em;
margin-bottom: 1em;
text-transform: lowercase;
}
This define style rule will be applicable to h1, h2 and h3 element as well. The
order of the list is irrelevant. All the elements in the selector will have the
corresponding declarations applied to them.
You can combine the various class selectors together as shown below:
#content, #footer, #supplement {
position: absolute;
left: 510px;
width: 200px;
}
