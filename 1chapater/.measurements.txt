CSS supports a number of measurements including absolute units such as
inches, centimeters, points, and so on, as well as relative measures such as
percentages and em units. You need these values while specifying various
measurements in your Style rules.
e.g. border="1px solid red

1.% Defines a measurement as a percentage relative to another value,typically an enclosing element.
example---->p {font-size: 16pt; line-height:125%;}

2.cm Defines a measurement in centimeters.
example--->div {margin-bottom: 2cm;}

3.em --> A relative measurement for the height of a font in em spaces.
Because an em unit is equivalent to the size of a given font, if you assign a font to 12pt, each "em" unit would
be 12pt; thus, 2em would be 24pt
example--->p {letter-spacing: 7em;}

4.px -->Defines a measurement in screen pixels.
example-->p {padding: 25px;}
