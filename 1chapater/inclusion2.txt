There are four ways to associate styles with your HTML document. Most
commonly used methods are inline CSS and External CSS.

1.Embedded CSS -The <style> Element
You can put your CSS rules into an HTML document using the <style> element.
This tag is placed inside the <head>...</head> tags. Rules defined using this
syntax will be applied to all the elements available in the document. Here is the
generic syntax:
<head>
<style type="text/css" media="...> 
Style Rules
............
</style>
</head>
type----Specifies the style sheet language as a content-type (MIME type). This is a required attribute.
media----Specifies the device, the document will be displayed on. Default value is all. This is an optional attribute.

2.Inline CSS -The style Attribute
You can use style attribute of any HTML element to define style rules. These
rules will be applied to that element only. Here is the generic syntax:
<element style="...style rules....">
<h1 style ="color:#36C;"> This is inline CSS </h1>

3.External CSS -The <link> Element
The <link> element can be used to include an external stylesheet file in your
HTML document.
An external style sheet is a separate text file with .css extension. You define all
the Style rules within this text file and then you can include this file in any HTML
document using <link> element.
Here is the generic syntax of including external CSS file:
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="..." media="..." />
</head>
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css" media="all" />
</head>

4.Imported CSS -@import Rule
@import is used to import an external stylesheet in a manner similar to the
<link> element. Here is the generic syntax of @import rule.
<head>
<@import "URL";
</head>
CSS Rules Overriding
We have discussed four ways to include style sheet rules in an HTML document.
Here is the rule to override any Style Sheet Rule.
1.Any inline style sheet takes the highest priority. So, it will override any
rule defined in <style>...</style> tags or the rules defined in any
external style sheet file.
2. Any rule defined in <style>...</style> tags will override the rules defined
in any external style sheet file.
3. Any rule defined in the external style sheet file takes the lowest priority,
and the rules defined in this file will be applied only when the above two
rules are not applicable.

************CSS Comments*******

Many times, you may need to put additional comments in your style sheet
blocks. So, it is very easy to comment any part in the style sheet. You can
simply put your comments inside /*.....this is a comment in style sheet.....*/.
